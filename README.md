# Memory Game

### Game Rules
* At the start of the game, the player is presented with a grid of 24 facedown cards.
* Each card should look identical face down but has a face-up value that is matched by only one other card on the table.
* When the player clicks a card, it flips over revealing its value.
* When one card is already revealed, if the player clicks another card, its value is then also revealed, and the two face-up cardsâ€™ values are compared.
    * If they are matched, then indicate this in the UI somehow.
    * If they are different, then they should flip back down.
* The game is continued until there are no cards left to match.
